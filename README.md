# PhotoCheckerTool
Quickly go through a list of photos to check whether or not they meet a criteria (is it a photo of me?)

TODO
Add ML component to verify images based on small subset

Instructions:
1. Run the file in a folder with images.
2. Images will appear. Press "y" if the image should be moved to the "Yes" folder or "n" if the image should be moved to the "No" folder.
(optional): Pressing R will undo the last move and place the image back into the original folder. This can undo mistakes made by the user.
